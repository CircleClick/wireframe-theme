<h4>The story of AnyContext is the story of the Internet, the two women whose careers span its evolution, and the insights they gained along the way.</h4>

<p>
	It begins at a blinking terminal with a DOS line command. Vanessa Camones is 10 years old when she starts gaming in MUDs and chatting on IRC. Her father’s passion for computer engineering, and her late nights spent at that terminal, spark Vanessa’s curiosity for exploring the early Internet. Thousands of miles away, Anne Ahola Ward is among the first kids in her school to own a Commodore 64. It is just the latest gadget she enjoys tinkering with and improving, inspired by her favorite childhood movie hero -- Q, James Bond’s trusty inventor.</p>

<p>They take their love of tech to college at a time when the Internet is first reaching the consumer market -- Anne at the University of Texas in Austin, where she works nights as an HTML editor for iBooks, an early digital content startup. Attending Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley, Vanessa is often seen lugging a brick-sized Motorola phone and a bulky laptop across campus, working as an editor for the school paper and as an intern for Lucent, Creative Labs, and Cunningham Communications -- the prestigious PR agency of record for Apple in the 90s.</p>

<p>
The story continues with Apple after college: Anne starts her career with the company’s Enterprise Education Department, helping build online influencer communities of educators. She joins the team that improves the early iTunes experience by synthesizing feedback and data directly from users. Here Anne learns that even the tiniest adjustment to a web page can lead to massive shifts in user behavior. In 2008 she brings what she’s learned at Apple to her own web development consultancy, and builds on it. While the tools for deploying sites are firmly in place, she realizes then, the tools for measuring and growing engagement on them are still evolving. Anne joins the pilot program for Google Analytics and dedicates herself to this new type of tinkering.</p>

<!-- <p class="quote">"Traffic, sales, all the wonderful things that come with it."</p> -->

<p class="quote">“The common thread in my career has been growth, especially since I left Apple,” as Anne puts it now. “Traffic, sales, all the wonderful things that come with it.”</p>

<p>Vanessa begins her post-college career at Niehaus Ryan Wong, the pioneering Silicon Valley Internet and technology agency, where she works on the Pixar Animation Studios account.</p>
<!-- <h4>Lessons from a master</h4> -->
<p>“Our team got to present our marketing plan for Toy Story 2 directly to Steve Jobs -- which he literally ripped up right in front of us, then told us to start over,”  Vanessa remembers. “So I guess you could say I learned about holding myself to high expectations from the master.”</p>
<p>She also helps launch Pixar’s 3D rendering platform, explaining how its complex technologies bring strange and beautiful creatures to life.</p>

<p>This helps crystallize her love of telling great stories through and about technology, and communicating through design. It solidifies further when she helps design and launch the iRiver clix, a competitor to the iPod created with a similar standard for elegant presentation and intuitive UI. Vanessa also works at HP and Cisco before heading up marketing at Atomz, a startup acquired by WebSideStory in 2005. She spends the next decade working with dozens of companies, helping build their brand and narrative while also becoming advisor and board member at several startups.</p>

<p>In 2007, Vanessa founds theMIX agency, a marketing and communications consultancy that creates content strategy and marketing programs for companies and organizations like RockYou, Geoloqi, SendGrid, Nokia, Institute for the Future, and the Stanford Center on Longevity. A year later, Anne founds CircleClick, an SEO/SEM agency that builds and enhances web engagement for companies like Heroku, Inc., oDesk, and UploadVR. </p>
<p>Their careers flourish in the succeeding years: Anne accepts a coveted invitation to IBM’s futurist program, and literally writes the book on SEO for O’Reilly Media. Vanessa authors frequent guest posts for outlets like TechCrunch and VentureBeat, speaks at conferences like the Clinton Global Initiative and SXSW (which she also advises), serves on the board of the Design Museum Foundation. They ride the seismic shifts in communication and content, led by the rise of social media and mobile, fueled further by cloud platforms and connected devices. </p>

<p><strong>This is where Anne and Vanessa meet.</strong> With united skill sets and shared core values, they found AnyContext, a full-service digital marketing consultancy and lab dedicated to telling the world about companies that matter. Through the combined tapestry of their career experiences, they know that beautifully designed, organic content is the gold standard for building brands, attracting users, and earning revenue. They know that branded content must always come with an integrated, cross-platform strategy, built on a steady foundation of code and SEO, to sail above the Internet’s deep and roiling sea. </p>
